# Proposal of Game

I'd like to make a space shooter in the vein of Space Invaders. This would be oriented sideways, rather than vertical. The player would move the ship up and down along the y axis and shoot missles/blasts. The enemies will start on the right side of the screen and progress towards the hero on the left, who must destroy them in order to survive and advance. The game is won after a certain number of "waves" are completed (enemies destroyed), and lost once the player is hit 3 times.

I know a lot of this will probably change over the course of programming everything, but I feel good about this as a starting framework. Below, I've listed some possible reach goals for after I have the basic game in place.

possible reach goals

1. different types of enemies/obstacles?
2. speed of enemies/obstacles increases over time?
3. background music?
4. sound effects (gun, explosions)?
5. "floating" movement rather than discrete once the button is pushed?
6. change ship size once you reach a certain score?
7. enemies/obstacles shoot back?
8. animate explosions?
