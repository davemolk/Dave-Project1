1. I planned out my game (after several false starts).

1. I got the HTML and CSS more or less where they need to be and planned out what sorts of functions I need. Spent time reviewing Crawler and similar instances of the type of game I'm working on.
2. I want to get things happening in JS. I'd like to write up the major classes I'll be using and hopefully get things on the canvas.
